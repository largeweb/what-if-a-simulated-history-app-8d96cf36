# Project Overview

Project Name: "What If...?" - A Simulated History App

Description: A web application that lets users explore alternate historical timelines based on a single, pivotal change to the past. The initial version will focus on a single "what-if" scenario and present the *simulated* outcomes in a visually engaging way.

Features:

*   "The Shot That Wasn't Heard": Our initial scenario explores "What if Archduke Franz Ferdinand wasn't assassinated?".
*   Interactive Timeline: A scrollable timeline that presents key events *after* the changed event. These are completely simulated, of course.
*   "Butterfly Effect" Cards:  Visually appealing cards that highlight the *simulated* consequences of the change. Examples: "No World War I", "Austria-Hungary Modernizes", "Rise of Global Pacifism". Each card contains a short, engaging description of the outcome.
*   "Expert Analysis" Section: A mocked section with quotes from "historians" commenting on the new timeline (purely fictional and for effect).

Technology Stack:
*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
